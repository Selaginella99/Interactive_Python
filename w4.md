## Week four 

####Lists — Lists
+ Lists can be constructed as a sequence of objects inside square brackets; e.g; [2,4,6]. The list function also converts other types of sequence data such as strings into [lists](http://www.codeskulptor.org/docs.html#Lists).
+ Sequence operations such as indexing l[i], concatenation +, length len(l) and slicing apply to lists.
+ As opposed to strings, an element of a list can be mutated via assignment l[i] = x.

####Points and vectors — Motion
+ A point in 2D is represented by a pair of Cartesian coordinates.
+ A vector in 2D is represented by a pair of numbers (its horizontal and vertical components).
+ Taking the difference of two points (componentwise) yields a vector.
+ Vectors can be added and scaled (componentwise). Points should not be added or scaled.
+ Adding a point and a vector (componentwise) yields a new point. This operation can be used to animate moving points.
+ Lecture examples - Timer Control, Formula Control
+ More examples - Drawing Vectors

####Distance computations — Collisions and reflections
+ The distance between two points p0 and p1 is 
√(p0[0]-p1[0])2+(p0[1]-p1[1])2 .
+ The distance between a point and a circle and the distance between two circles follows from this formula.
+ The set of points [x,y] that satisfy the equation a*x + b*y + c == 0 is a line. The distance from this line to a point p is 
(a*p[0] + b*p[1] + c)/ √a2 + b2
+ The distance from a circle to a line is the distance from the center of the circle to the line minus the radius.
+ Lecture examples - Timer Control
+ More examples - Drawing Vectors

####Reflections — Collisions and reflections
+ The direction of reflection for a ball bouncing off of a wall depends on the incoming velocity vector v and the normal vector to the wall at the point of contact.
+ The incoming velocity vector can be decomposed into v = vp + vn where vn is the component of v orthogonal to wall and vp is the component parallel to to the wall.
+ In this model, the reflected vector is v = vp - vn.
+ This model simplifies for horizontal and vertical walls. In particular, reflection simply negates one component of the velocity vector v.

####Keyboard events — Keyboard input
+ SimpleGUI suppports two event handlers for keyboard events.
+ The key down event handler is registered via set_keydown_handler.
+ The key up event handler is registered via set_keyup_handler.
+ The variable passed to each of these handlers is a number that can be compared at the constants in KEY_MAP to determine which key has been pressed.
+ Lecture examples - [Echo](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#examples-keyboard_echo.py)
+ More examples - Shape Selection

####Positional control — Keyboard input
+ We can control the position of a point p directly using key board events.
+ The horizontal and vertical components of a point p's position can be increment/decrement via p[i] += c in response to key presses.
+ Lecture examples - [Ball Position](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#examples-keyboard-1.py)
+ More examples - None

####Velocity control — Velocity control
+ Basic physics relates the position of a point p and its velocity v via the equation p += dt * v where dt is a small time step.
+ In this model, we can control the motion of p via keyup/keydown events that increment/decrement the two components of the velocity vector v via v[i] += c.

####Mutable vs. immutable data — Programming tips #4
+ Numbers, Booleans and strings are immutable and can not be modified. Only new copies of these kinds of data can be made.
On the other hand, parts of a list can be mutated via assignment to individual elements of the list.
+ Assignment of an entire list to a variable generates a reference that refers to the list. Subsequent assignment may generate multiple references to the same list.
+ Mutating a list with multiple references modifies all references to the list. This capability is very useful, but can generate subtle errors.
