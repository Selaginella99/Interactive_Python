###Week three 

#### Canvas — Canvas and drawing
+ The canvas is the area associated with an application where information contain in the application may be drawn.
+ In SimpleGUI applications, the width and height of the canvas are specified (in pixels) in `create_frame`. (A pixel is the smallest unit of area that your computer can draw in.)
+ The origin for the canvas is the upper left-hand corner.
+ Positions in the canvas are specified as pairs `[x,y]` where x is the horizontal coordinate and `y` is the vertical coordinate.
+ Lecture examples -[Canvas and Drawing](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#examples-canvas_and_drawing.py)
+ More examples - [Structure](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#examples-more-3a_canvas_and_drawing-structure.py)

#### Event-driven drawing — Canvas and drawing
+ Computers refresh their screens around 60 times per sec.
+ For each application, the computer calls a special event handler, the draw handler, that is registered to the application.
+ In SimpleGUI, the draw handler is registered via set_draw_handler.
+ The draw handler can modify the canvas via simple draw operations defined in SimplGUI

#### String operations — String processing
The function str converts other types of data into a string.
The concatenation operator + joins two strings to form a single string,
The ith element of a string my_string can be access via my_string[i]. Note that strings are immutable (cannot be changed).
Substrings of my_string can be accessed via slicing .
Lecture examples - Strings, Dollars and Cents One, Dollars and Cents Two

#### Drawing text — Interactive drawing
The method draw_text draws a string when given a position (lower left corner), a font size and a color.
The method draw_circle (see "More examples" below) draws a circle at a given point with a given radius in pixels. To draw a point, draw a circle of radius one.
The method draw_line (see "More examples" below) draws a line between two points.
The method draw_polygon (see "More examples" below) draws a sequence of points (enclosed in square brackets and separated by commas) as a closed polygon.
Colors for drawing methods can be specified as HTML color strings; "White", "Red", "Green", ...

#### Timers — Timers
Timers are another component of SimpleGUI that generate regularly timed events.
Users create a timer using create_timer with a specified interval and event handler.
The timer calls its associated event handler regularly at the given interval.
A timer t is started with t.start() and is stopped by t.stop().
